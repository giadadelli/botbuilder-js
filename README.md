# Bot Builder SDK v4
This repository contains code for the JavaScript version of the [Microsoft Bot Builder SDK](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder). The 4.x version of the SDK is being actively developed and should therefore be used for **EXPERIMENTATION PURPOSES ONLY**. Production bots should continue to be developed using the [v3 SDK](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder/tree/master/Node). In addition to the JavaScript SDK, Bot Builder supports creating bots in other popular programming languages like [.Net](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-dotnet), [Python](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-python), and [Java](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-java).
